# Car-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning model for car price prediction.  

Downloaded the CarPrice.csv dataset from kaggle.  

Have used DecisionTree Algorithm to create the Regression Model for the predictions and tested the performance of the model by giving inputs to this model according to the features that I have used to train the model.  

The accuracy of model is ~99 %.
